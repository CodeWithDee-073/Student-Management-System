## Student Management System

### A simple C++ project to manage student records. This system allows you to add, view, search, and update student details. Data is stored in a text file for easy access.

### Features:
- ➕ Add student details (roll number, name, parent's name, class, address)
- 👀 View student records
- 🔍 Search for a student by roll number
- ✏ Update an existing student's details

### How It Works: 
1. Run the program.
2. Choose an option:
   - **1**: Add a new student
   - **2**: View all records
   - **3**: Search for a student
   - **4**: Update details
   - **5**: Exit  
3. Follow the prompts. Data is saved in `data.txt`.

### Concepts Used:
- **OOP**: `Student` class encapsulates student details.
- **File Handling**: Data is stored and managed in `data.txt`.
- **String Manipulation**: Data is separated by delimiters (e.g., `|`) for easy parsing.
